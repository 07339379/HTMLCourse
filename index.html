      <h3>Who are matea?</h3> 
      <p> Mahber tyatr asmara(Mae'a &trade;) or Asmara Thater association was founded by interested citizens to push for an Eritrean cultural and national renaissance. Beside the association goals Eritrean cultur and identity. it also strongly pushed to empower and embolden the youth to stand up against Ethiopian rule by promoting resistance through music and poetry.For this reason,the associaton was always under heavy surveillance and censorship by the Ethiopian government. But this didnt stop many of the members from writing many cryptice fervor in the youth. </p>
      <p>
       Seeming romantic or sipmle song about life in general would have a differnt invigorating meaning to many youth of the time. notabe songs can be.
